# ff2mpv-rust

</div>

Native messaging host for ff2mpv written in Rust.

This is a native compiled binary, so it runs much faster and doesn't require external dependencies by itself, unlike Python and Ruby scripts.

# What is this?
This is a script for hooking mpv and [ff2mpv](https://github.com/woodruffw/ff2mpv), that allows opening any video link in mpv straight from the browser.
